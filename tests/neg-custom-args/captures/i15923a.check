  |Found:    (lcap: Cap^'s1) ->'s2 () ->'s3 Id[Cap^'s4]^'s5
  |Required: (lcap: Cap^) => () =>² Id[Cap^'s6]^'s7
  |
  |where:    =>  refers to a fresh root capability created in value leak when checking argument to parameter op of method withCap
  |          =>² refers to a root capability associated with the result type of (lcap: Cap^): () =>² Id[Cap^'s6]^'s7
  |          ^   refers to the universal root capability
  |
  |Note that capability <cap of (): Id[Cap^'s4]^'s5> cannot be included in outer capture set 's6.
